# Challenge 11:UFO's
The purpose of this project was to create a simple, dynamic website, that compiles data from many different UFO sightings from around the US. The UFO data populating the webpage can be filtered by a variety of parameters specified by the user, such as by the city, date, or shape of the sighting.

First part of the page with the header, title, and organized paragraphs.

Lower part of the page contains the UFO data in a compact table with sections of information, and a search tool on the left side for users to filter results for those sections (date, city, state, country, or shape). The example above shows the input text boxes, along with the sections result's format.

# Overall Summary
With the unique tools of Javascript, you can provide a useful and simple website for all sorts of situations. Data can be stored and filtered many ways in a table, making it quick and efficient for the user. Only drawbacks would be missing a drop down menu when inputing characters into the textbox so the newer users know what to filter and as well as error messages when a certain input in the filter is not recognized from the dataset, instead nothing shows.
